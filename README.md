# House-Prices-Predictor
Due to the current rise in house prices, I was interested in building a house price predictor.
I web-scraped the most current housing data I found for the accuracy of this project.
This project uses machine learning models to predict future house prices. 

Learning goals:
1. Learn web scraping
2. Use different machine learning models
3. Practice data visualization

This project is split into 2 files: 
- one for data cleaning, and
- one for analysis and model development
